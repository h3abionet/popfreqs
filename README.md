# H3Africa Population frequencies

**Frequencies of populations in H3Africa**.

## Introduction
The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with docker containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.

This workflow computes allele frequencies of populations in the H3Africa consortium and add that to a single VCF with no genotypes

<!-- TODO nf-core: Add a brief overview of what the pipeline does and how it works -->
